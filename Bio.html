            <p>I am a current Cybersecurity and Networking student and ex Paramedic. 
                Prior to my current change in careers, I worked as a Paramedic for about seven years and as an EMT for approximately two years.
                I also serve my community as a member of my local volunteer fire department and have for about 10 years. 
                I have had an interest in technology and computer's from a young age.</p>

            <p>I discovered my love for technology, thanks to the teaching of my Grandfather. 
                He would go to an Army Surplus store and buy cheap computer parts which we would use to build computers for ourselves and our family members.
                My first build was around the age of five or six years old (obviously a lot of help from him) and I believe that the computer had windows 95 or 98.
                One of my old computer builds is actually still being used today by my father.
